ACTIVITIES
Not to be boastful, but I like to think of myself as a very passionate computer scientist. I have been
striving to better myself and grow my skillset ever since I started working formally. I spend my
free time exploring new technologies and honing the ones that I have learned. I like to read books
on Software engineering practices, mastering JavaScript and its associated technologies, and in
general computer sciences.
